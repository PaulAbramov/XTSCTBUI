# XTSCTBUI - Bot Management Interface

A dedicated management dashboard built to control and monitor the [CardTradeBot (CTB)](https://github.com/PaulAbramov/CTB) core engine.

### 🧩 Purpose
While the CTB core handles the "heavy lifting" of account communication, XTSCTBUI provides a centralized interface for users to manage dozens of accounts simultaneously, monitor farming progress, and track trade logs in real-time.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Multi-Bot Dashboard:** View the status, active game, and connection state of every bot instance in one place.
* **Account Configuration:** Easily update credentials, 2FA settings, and farming priorities for individual bots.
* **Live Logging:** Real-time feedback from the core engine regarding trade successes and card drops.
* **User-Friendly Management:** Simplifies the deployment of multiple automation instances without needing to interact with the console.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** C#
* **Framework:** .NET (Desktop UI)
* **Integration:** Directly interfaces with the CTB Core Library.
